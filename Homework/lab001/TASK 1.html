      Even though modern webside are generally built with user-friendly
      interfaces, it's useful to know some basic HTML some basic HTML. If you
      know the follwing 17 HTML example tags (and a few extras),you'll be able
      to create a basic webpage from scratch or tweak the code create by an app
      like WordPress.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've provided HTML code example with output for most of the tags. If you
      want to see them in action, download the sample HTML file at the end of
      the article. You can play with it in a text editor and load it up in a
      browser to see what you changes do.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3E2F2A;">1.&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3E2F2A;">
    <hr style="margin-top: 0px; color: #3E2F2A;  border-width: 2px;">
    <p>
      You'll need this tag at the beginning of every HTML documentyou create. It
      ensures that a browser knows that it's reading HTML,and that it expects
      HTML5, latest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still a good one to
      know.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3E2F2A;">2.&lthtml&gt</h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3E2F2A;">
    <hr style="margin-top: 0px; color: #3E2F2A;  border-width: 2px;">
    <p>
      This is another tah that tells a browser that it's reading HTML. The
      &lthtml&gt tag goes straight after the DOCTYPE tag, and you close it with
      a &lt/html&gt tag right at the end of your file. Everything else is your
      document goes between these tags.
